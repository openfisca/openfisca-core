## 14.1.0 - [#528](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/528)

#### New features

- Introduce `/calculate` route in the preview API
  - Allows to run calculations.
  - Takes a simulation `JSON` as an input, and returns a copy of the input extended with calculation results.

- Handle `500` errors in the preview API
    - In this case, the API returns a JSON with details about the error.

- Allows simulations to be built from a JSON using their constructor
  - For instance `Simulation(simulation_json = {"persons": {...}, "households": {...}}, tax_benefit_system = tax_benefit_system)`

- Allows entities to be built from a JSON using their constructor
  - For instance `Household(simulation, {"first_household": {...}})`

- Introduce `tax_benefit_system.get_variables(entity = None)`
  - Allows to get all variables contained in a tax and benefit system, with filtering by entity

#### Deprecations

- Deprecate `simulation.holder_by_name`, `simulation.get_holder`, `get_or_new_holder`
  - These functionalities are now provided by `entity.get_holder(name)`

- Deprecate constructor `Holder(simulation, column)`
  - A `Holder` should now be instanciated with `Holder(entity = entity, column = column)`

### 14.0.1 - [#527](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/527)

* Improve error message and add stack trace when a module import fails

# 14.0.0 - [#522](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/522)

#### Breaking changes

- In variables:
  - Merge `Variable` and `DatedVariable`.
    - `Variable` can now handle formula evolution over time.
  - Remove `start_date` attribute 
  - Rename `stop_date` attribute to `end`
    - Introduce end string format `end = 'YYYY-MM-DD'`
- In formulas:
  - Merge `SimpleFormula` and `DatedFormula`.
    - `Formula` evolves over time.
  - Remove `@dated_function`
    - start definition goes to formula name: `formula_YYYY[_MM[_DD]]`
    - stop is deduced from next formula start

  Before:
  ```
  class your_variable(DatedVariable):
      # ... attributes
      start_date = datetime.date(2015, 05, 01)
      stop_date = datetime.date(2017, 05, 31)

      # openfisca chooses most restrictive start in (start_date, @dated_function start)
      @dated_function(start = date(2015, 1, 1), stop = date(2016, 12, 31))
      def function_2015_something(self, simulation, period):
          # Calculate for 2015

      @dated_function(start = date(2016, 1, 1))
      def function__different_name(self, simulation, period):
          # Calculate for 2016 > 2017-05-31 (including 2017-05-31 stop_date day)
  ```
  After:
  ```
  class your_variable(Variable):
      # ... unchanged attributes
      end = '2017-05-31'  # string format 'YYYY-MM-DD'

      # name should begin with 'formula' / you define the start in the name
      def formula_2015_05_01(self, simulation, period):  # stops on last day before next formula
          # Calculate for 2015

      def formula_2016(self, simulation, period):  # similar to formula_2016_01_01 or formula_2016_01
          # Calculate for 2016+ > 2017-05-31 (including 2017-05-31 end day)
  ```

#### New features

- Change `ETERNITY` period effect
  - Remove restriction that prevented formula changes over time for a variable with `definition_period = ETERNITY`.

### 13.0.1 - [#526](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/526)

### Bug fix

* Require numpy < 1.13.
  - Openfisca is not yet compatible with the new numpy version 1.13.

# 13.0.0

#### Breaking changes

* Disallow text out of tags in XML parameters
  - This prevents to add "comments" that would be lost by automated transformation of these parameters.

#### New features

* Introduce a "reference" attribute to document a source in XML parameters

## 12.3.0

* Serve the [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) under the API route `/spec/`

## 12.2.0

* Use `nose` in the `openfisca-run-test` script
  - This avoids boilerplate code on country packages, and makes parallelism easier to set on Circle CI.

### 12.1.4

* Fix package naming conflict between the preview API and the official one.
* Fix import error

### 12.1.3

* Validate XML parameters with lxml and a XML Schema
* Raise nicer errors during validation

### 12.1.2

* Improve the error when the period argument is forgotten in entity call

### 12.1.1

* When replacing a variable by another one in a reform, assume the new variable has the same metadata than the reference one.
  - The is currently the behaviour for all other metadata.

## 12.1.0

* Include the preview API into OpenFisca-Core
* Remove internationalization (`i18n`, `Babel`)
* Use CircleCI instead of Travis

### 12.0.3

* Fix variable `source_file_path` computation.
  - Make sure the tax and benefit system `location` metadata is consistent with the actual python files being loaded.

### 12.0.2

* Fix a bug introduced by 11.0.0: variables with several references could not be loaded.

### 12.0.1

* Fix a bug introduced by 12.0.0: the description of a parameter node was no longer exported in the parameter JSON.

# 12.0.0

#### Breaking changes

* Deprecate and remove the `fin` attribute in XML parameters.
  - The end date of a parameter is assumed to be the start of the next one.
  - The `<END>` indicates that a parameter does not exist anymore
* Deprecate and remove the `fuzzy` attribute in XML parameters.
  - By construction, the value of a parameter is always extended towards the future.
  - To indicate a likely change of the legislation, a `<PLACEHOLDER>` can be added.
* Deprecate and remove `reforms.create_item`
  - New items are created directly with the method `reforms.update_items`.
* Deprecate and remove `reforms.split_item_containing_instant`
  - Splitting items does not make sense in the new convention. Use `reform.update_items` to update the parameters.

# 11.0.0

#### Breaking changes

These breaking changes only concern variable and tax and benefit system **metadata**. They **do not** impact calculations.

* Make `tax_benefit_system.get_package_metadata()` return a `dict` instead of a `tuple`
* Make `column.source_file_path` a relative path (was absolute before)
* Make `column.url` a list instead of a string

#### New features

* Make `tax_benefit_system.get_package_metadata()` more robust
  - Handle reforms
  - Handle tax and benefit systems that are not defined within a package and/or a distribution

#### Technical changes

* Turn `Variable`s with a `start_date` and/or a `stop_date` into `DatedVariable`s
  - This is transparent for users.

### 10.0.2

* Do not cache values for neutralized variables
  - To reduce memory usage for large population simulations

### 10.0.1

* Improve the raised error message when a wrong period type is given as an input

# 10.0.0

#### Breaking changes

* In YAML tests:
  - Deprecate and remove the `IGNORE_` prefix
  - Deprecate and remove the `ignore` property
* In the YAML test runner:
  - Deprecate and remove the `force` option (`-f` in the shell script)
  - Deprecate and remove the `default_absolute_error_margin` option (`-M` in the shell script)
  - Deprecate and remove the `default_relative_error_margin` option (`-m` in the shell script)

#### New features

* Add `Reform` and `numpy.round` (as `round_`) in the model API
* Introduce `tax_benefit_system.apply_reform(reform_path)`
* Allow YAML tests to declare the reforms they need to be executed (through the `reforms` property)

#### Technical changes

* Move the `dummy_extension` to `OpenFisca-Dummy-Country`
* Test `openfisca-run-test` script

## 9.1.0

* Rename `neutralize_column` to `neutralize_variable`
  - Deprecate `neutralize_column` without removing it
* Document `neutralize_variable`

### 9.0.2

* Fix spelling in error messages

### 9.0.1

* Test marginal scales
* Move tests out of the main package
* These changes are transparent for users

# 9.0.0

* Make sure identic periods are stringified the same way
* _Breaking changes_:
  - Change `periods.period` signature.
    - It now only accepts strings.
  - Restrict the possible inputs for `periods.period`
    - The authorized formats are listed in [the doc](https://doc.openfisca.fr/periodsinstants.html)
  - Deprecate and remove:
    - `periods.json_or_python_to_period`
    - `periods.make_json_or_python_to_period`

### 8.0.1

* Move the dummy country to [its own repository](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-dummy-country)

# 8.0.0

* Raise more explicit error when an invalid test case is given
* Raise more friendly error when trying to calculate a variable which doesn't exist
* _Breaking change_: Python exceptions will now be raised when the test case in invalid. Before, only a byriani error was returned. Reusers must therefore adapt their exception handling.

## 7.1.0

* Add `Entity.to_json` method. Used by OpenFisca-Web-API in `/entity` endpoint in particular.

### 7.0.1

* Declare `Openfisca-Parsers` as an optional dependency of `Openfisca-Core`.

# 7.0.0

* Make it mandatory to provide a period when calculating a variable.
  - When a computation is requested (with *.calculate_output, entities.__call__, *.calculate[_add|_divide], *.compute[_add|_divide]), the argument `period` is no longer optional.
  - Previously, the period of the simulation was used instead of a missing period. It was error-prone, as values would be returned for the wrong period, without any error or warning to alert the formula writer about a likely coding error.

## 6.1.0

* Move `base.py` content (file usually located in country packages) to core module `formula_toolbox` so that it can be reused by all countries
* Use `AbstractScenario` if no custom scenario is defined for a tax and benefit sytem

# 6.0.0

#### Breaking changes

* Add **mandatory** attribute `definition_period` to variables
* Enforce that inputs provided for a variable match the variable `definition_period`
  - If a `set_input` attribute has been defined, automatically cast the input accordingly.
* Change the expected output of a formula
  - Only `result` must be returned, instead of `period, result`
* Deprecate and remove:
  - `simulation.print_trace`
  - `simulation.calculate_add_divide` and `simulation.compute_add_divide`
  - `last_duration_last_value` base function
  - `variables_name_to_skip` and `use_set_input_hooks` parameters in `scenario.fill_simulation`
  - `holders.new_test_case_array`
* Deprecate and forbid `dated_holder.array = ...`
* Raise an error when inconsistent year and month inputs provided for a variable
  - Before, the year value would be silently ignored.
* Rename `period.this_month` to `period.first_month`

#### Technical changes

* Make sure the cache only store values for periods matching the variable `definition_period`
* Use a cache buffer in simulation initialisation when axes are used, to avoid `set_input` conflicts
* Make `DatedHolder` only a wrapper of a variable value for a given period, and no more a dated view of a `Holder`

#### Documentation

* the attribute `definition_period` is documented here : https://doc.openfisca.fr/coding-the-legislation/35_periods.html

### 5.0.2

* Add `TaxBenefitSystem` doc to the reference doc
  - This is transparent for all users

### 5.0.1

* Improve `openfisca-run-test` script
  - Make country package detection more robust (it only worked for packages installed in editable mode)
  - Use spaces instead of commas as separator in the script arguments when loading several extensions or reforms (this is more standard)
* Refactor the `scripts` module to seperate the logic specific to yaml test running from the one that can be re-used by any script which needs to build a tax and benefit system.

# 5.0.0

* Move `json_or_python_to_test_case` from country packages to core
* Breaking change: `scenarios.set_entities_json_id` has been moved, and should not be considered a public function.

### 4.3.6

* Bug fix : handle the case when CompactNode.name is None.

### 4.3.5

* Refactor decomposition TaxBenefitSystem attributes. Reform inherit the decomposition_file_path from the reference TaxBenefitSystem.
  This does not require changing anything from the caller, which should use the `decompositions.get_decomposition_json` function instead of those attributes.

### 4.3.4

* Fix occasionnal `NaN` creation in `MarginalRateTaxScale.calc` resulting from `0 * np.inf`

### 4.3.3

* Use the actual TaxBenefitSystem and not its reference when neutralizing a column.

### 4.3.2

* Fix `to_value_json` for `DatedVariable` with extra parameters.

This was causing a crash when calculating intermediate variables with the API.

Unlike simple formulas, a `DatedVariable` have several functions. We thus need to select the right one according to the period before doing parameters introspection.

### 4.3.1

* Fix `set_input` and `default` setting in `new_filled_column`

## 4.3.0

* Add reference documentation

### 4.2.1

* Fix permanent and period size independent variables neutralization

## 4.2.0

* Introduce a YAML test runner in openfisca_core
  - Introduce command line tool `openfisca-run-test`

* Refactor the dummy tax benefit system included in openfisca-core
  - Make the dummy country look like a real one
  - Split defining the country from testing

### 4.1.7

* Improve docstring of `MarginalTaxRate.inverse` and add test

### 4.1.6

* Decrease verbosity of `combine_tax_scales`

### 4.1.5

* Enable `extra_params` in formulas with new syntax.

### 4.1.4-Beta

* Fixup 4.1.2:
  * When building positions, handle cases where persons belonging to an entity are not grouped by entity in the persons array.

### 4.1.3-Beta

* Fix bug in entity.sum

### 4.1.2-Beta

* Enable simulation initialization with only legacy roles
  * New roles are in this case automatically infered
  * Positions are always infered from persons entity id

### 4.1.1-Beta

* Fix update_legislation in reforms

### 4.1.0-Beta

* Add `conflicts` and `origin` fields to xml params (needed for baremes IPP importation)

### 4.0.0-Beta

  * Refactor formula syntax

    - Don't use the object simulation in formula writing. The entity the variable is calculated for is now the first argument of the formula, for instance `person` or `family`.

    - The `legislation` is now the (optional) third argument of a formula. It is a function that can be called with a period (or an instant) for argument, and will compute the legislation at `period.start`.

    -  Don't use `calculate_add` and equivalents. Instead, `add` and `divide` are just given in the `options` argument, for instance `options = [ADD]`.

    - Rename `entity_class` to `entity`.

    - Don't explicitly use a `calculate` method, but the `person('salary', period)` notation instead.

  * Introduce implicit conversions between entities, and improve aggregations formulas.

  * Deprecate PersonToEntityColumn and EntityToPersonColumn

  * Change the way entities are declared

  More information on https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/pull/415

## 3.1.0

* Add a `DeprecationWarning` when using a `DateCol` with no `default`, but keep the default date to 1970-01-01.
* Enforce `DateCol.default` to be a `date`.

### 3.0.3

* Fix `cerfa_field` validation in `Column`, `Formula` and `AbstractConversionVariable`.
  Previously, some variables having `cerfa_field` as a `dict` were converted to `unicode` by mistake.
  See https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france/issues/543

### 3.0.2

* Move `calmar.py` to [OpenFisca-Survey-Manager](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-survey-manager).

  No incidence on users since it was only needed for dataframes.

### 3.0.1

* Adapt requested_period_last_value and last_duration_last_value to extra params

# 3.0.0

* Update introspection data. This allows to enhance data served by the web API which itself feeds the Legislation Explorer.

### 2.2.2

* Update travis procedures

### 2.2.1

* Remove conda from travis config

## 2.2.0

* Implement simulation.calculate `print_trace=True` argument. Options: `max_depth` and `show_default_values`

  Examples:
  ```python
  simulation = scenario.new_simulation(trace=True)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True, max_depth=-1)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True, max_depth=-1, show_default_values=False)
  ```
