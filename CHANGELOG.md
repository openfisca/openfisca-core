# Changelog

## 4.2.1

*  Fix permanent and period size independent variables neutralization

* Fix occasionnal `NaN` creation in `MarginalRateTaxScale.calc` resulting from `0 * np.inf`

## 4.2.0

* Introduce a YAML test runner in openfisca_core
  - Introduce command line tool `openfisca-run-test`

* Refactor the dummy tax benefit system included in openfisca-core
  - Make the dummy country look like a real one
  - Split defining the country from testing

## 4.1.7

* Improve docstring of `MarginalTaxRate.inverse` and add test

## 4.1.6

* Decrease verbosity of `combine_tax_scales`

## 4.1.5

* Enable `extra_params` in formulas with new syntax.

## 4.1.4-Beta

* Fixup 4.1.2:
  * When building positions, handle cases where persons belonging to an entity are not grouped by entity in the persons array.

## 4.1.3-Beta

* Fix bug in entity.sum

## 4.1.2-Beta

* Enable simulation initialization with only legacy roles
  * New roles are in this case automatically infered
  * Positions are always infered from persons entity id

## 4.1.1-Beta

* Fix update_legislation in reforms

## 4.1.0-Beta

* Add `conflicts` and `origin` fields to xml params (needed for baremes IPP importation)

## 4.0.0-Beta

  * Refactor formula syntax

    - Don't use the object simulation in formula writing. The entity the variable is calculated for is now the first argument of the formula, for instance `person` or `family`.

    - The `legislation` is now the (optional) third argument of a formula. It is a function that can be called with a period (or an instant) for argument, and will compute the legislation at `period.start`.

    -  Don't use `calculate_add` and equivalents. Instead, `add` and `divide` are just given in the `options` argument, for instance `options = [ADD]`.

    - Rename `entity_class` to `entity`.

    - Don't explicitly use a `calculate` method, but the `person('salary', period)` notation instead.

  * Introduce implicit conversions between entities, and improve aggregations formulas.

  * Deprecate PersonToEntityColumn and EntityToPersonColumn

  * Change the way entities are declared

## 3.1.0

* Add a `DeprecationWarning` when using a `DateCol` with no `default`, but keep the default date to 1970-01-01.
* Enforce `DateCol.default` to be a `date`.

## 3.0.3

* Fix `cerfa_field` validation in `Column`, `Formula` and `AbstractConversionVariable`.
  Previously, some variables having `cerfa_field` as a `dict` were converted to `unicode` by mistake.
  See https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france/issues/543

## 3.0.2

* Move `calmar.py` to [OpenFisca-Survey-Manager](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-survey-manager).

  No incidence on users since it was only needed for dataframes.

## 3.0.1

* Adapt requested_period_last_value and last_duration_last_value to extra params

## 3.0.0

* Update introspection data. This allows to enhance data served by the web API which itself feeds the Legislation Explorer.

## 2.2.2

* Update travis procedures

## 2.2.1

* Remove conda from travis config

## 2.2.0

* Implement simulation.calculate `print_trace=True` argument. Options: `max_depth` and `show_default_values`

  Examples:
  ```python
  simulation = scenario.new_simulation(trace=True)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True, max_depth=-1)
  simulation.calculate('irpp', 2014, print_trace=True, max_depth=-1, show_default_values=False)
  ```
