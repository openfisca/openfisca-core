class Tracer(object):
    """
        A tracer that records simulation steps to enable exploring calculation steps in details.

        .. py:attribute:: requested_calculations

            ``set`` containing calculations that have been directly requested by the client.

            Value example:

            >>> {'income_tax<2017-01>', 'basic_income<2017-01>'}

        .. py:attribute:: stack

            ``list`` of the calculations that have started, but have not finished. The first item is one of the :attr:`requested_calculations`, and each other item is a dependency of the one preceding him. Note that after a calculation is finished, :attr:`stack` is always `[]``.

            Value example:

            >>> ['income_tax<2017-01>', 'global_income<2017-01>', 'salary<2017-01>']

        .. py:attribute:: trace

            ``dict`` containing, for each calculation, its result and its immediate dependencies.

            Value example:

            .. code-block:: python

              {
                'income_tax<2017-01': {
                  'dependencies':['global_income<2017-01>', 'nb_children<2017-01>']
                  'value': 600
